Recommendations for Mohi ERP Enhancement
Based on IDURAR's strengths, here are features you should consider adding:

High Priority (Immediate Value)
Quote Management Module

- Create quotes for distributors
- Convert approved quotes to orders
- Quote expiry tracking
- Quote approval workflow
Email Integration

- Send invoices via email (PDF attachment)
- Send payment reminders for overdue invoices
- Order confirmation emails
- Use free SMTP or services like SendGrid/Mailgun
Enhanced Dashboard

- Sales charts (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Payment collection trends
- Top distributors by revenue
- Inventory alerts (low stock, expiring soon)
- Outstanding payments summary
Better Payment Calculation

# Adopt IDURAR's smart calculation
def calculate_payment_status(total, discount, credit):
    net_total = total - discount
    if credit >= net_total:
        return 'paid'
    elif credit > 0:
        return 'partial'
    else:
        return 'unpaid'
Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
Recurring Orders

- Set up recurring orders for regular distributors
- Auto-generate orders weekly/monthly
- Useful for standing orders
Credit Limit Management

- Set credit limits per distributor
- Block orders if credit limit exceeded
- Credit utilization tracking
Multi-currency Support (if you export)

- Support USD, EUR, etc.
- Exchange rate management
- Currency conversion on invoices
Advanced Reporting

- GST reports (GSTR-1, GSTR-3B ready)
- Sales register
- Purchase register
- Profit & Loss statement
- Balance sheet
Low Priority (Future)
Mobile App (React Native or Flutter)

Sales team can create orders on the go
Distributor portal to view orders/payments
API for Integration

REST API for third-party integrations
Webhook support for events
Should You Switch to IDURAR?
NO - Here's why:

Indian Compliance Missing: IDURAR doesn't have GST, FSSAI, or Indian tax compliance built-in. You'd need to heavily customize it.

No Inventory Management: IDURAR is focused on invoicing/CRM, not inventory. Your FMCG business needs batch tracking and warehouse management.

Deployment Complexity: IDURAR requires MongoDB Atlas (cloud) or self-hosted MongoDB, which increases costs and complexity.

Your Current System Works: Mohi ERP already has the core features you need with Indian compliance. It's better to enhance it than start over.

Learning Curve: Your team would need to learn React, Node.js, and MongoDB to maintain IDURAR.

Best Path Forward
Keep Mohi ERP and selectively adopt IDURAR's best practices:

Immediate Actions (1-2 weeks):

Add Quote Management module
Enhance dashboard with charts (use Chart.js or Plotly)
Improve payment calculation logic
Short-term (1 month):

Add email integration for invoices
Create GST reports (GSTR-1 format)
Add credit limit management
Long-term (3-6 months):

Consider migrating frontend to React (optional)
Build mobile app for sales team
Add advanced analytics
Code Patterns to Adopt from IDURAR
Modular Controller Pattern:

# Create a base CRUD controller class
class BaseCRUDController:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
    
    def list(self):
        return self.model.query.all()
    
    def create(self, data):
        obj = self.model(**data)
        db.session.add(obj)
        db.session.commit()
        return obj
Smart Payment Status Calculation:

def update_payment_status(order):
    total_paid = sum(p.amount for p in order.payments if p.status == 'cleared')
    net_total = order.total_amount - order.discount
    
    if total_paid >= net_total:
        order.payment_status = 'paid'
    elif total_paid > 0:
        order.payment_status = 'partial'
    else:
        order.payment_status = 'unpaid'
Validation Schema (use Marshmallow or Pydantic):

from marshmallow import Schema, fields, validate

class OrderSchema(Schema):
    distributor_id = fields.Int(required=True)
    order_date = fields.Date(required=True)
    items = fields.List(fields.Dict(), required=True, validate=validate.Length(min=1))
Summary
IDURAR is a well-architected, modern ERP/CRM system with excellent UI/UX and modular design. However, it's not suitable for your Indian FMCG business due to lack of:

GST compliance
FSSAI batch tracking
Inventory management
Indian tax structure
Mohi ERP is already tailored for your needs with Indian compliance, inventory management, and FMCG-specific features. The best approach is to enhance Mohi ERP by adopting IDURAR's best practices like quote management, email integration, and better dashboard analytics.

Would you like me to start implementing any of these enhancements? I'd recommend starting with:

Quote Management module
Enhanced dashboard with charts
Email integration for invoices
